## Users of the Web App
It's built for product managers. They can send emails to their respective users and ask them few questions regarding their product exerience. Emaily then collects all those feedbacks and displays the result to the users (product managers).

## Billing
Users have to pay a fee to use this service. I have used Stripe for payment integration.

## Google Authentication
Users can sign up or login using their gmail account. I have intergated google o-auth api for the same.
