# Feedback Collector

Welcome to Feedback Collector! I built this application for getting hands on experience on fullstack development in MERN stack.

You can check out the application here - https://afternoon-beach-53955.herokuapp.com/


## Users of the Web App
It's built for product managers to collect feedback from their respective users through emails.

## Billing
Users have to pay a fee to use this service. I have used Stripe for payment integration.

## Google Authentication
Users can sign up or login using their gmail account. I have intergated google o-auth flow for the same.
